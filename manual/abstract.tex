\begin{abstract}
    This paper presents a formalization of a shortest augmenting path algorithm for finding a maximum cardinality matching in a bipartite graph in Isabelle/HOL. In particular, a formal specification of the algorithm and a formal proof of its correctness are given. The specification is then refined to obtain a verified implementation of the algorithm.
