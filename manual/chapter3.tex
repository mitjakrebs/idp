\part{Shortest augmenting path algorithm}
\label{ch:3}

This part formalizes the shortest augmenting path algorithm. As mentioned in part \ref{ch:2}, the algorithm uses a modified BFS as a subroutine to find an augmenting path. To formalize the modified BFS, we first formalized standard BFS. All three algorithms, that is, the shortest augmenting path algorithm, BFS, as well as the modified BFS, are first specified using the interfaces presented in part \ref{ch:2} and then implemented using the interface implementations also presented in part \ref{ch:2}. Let us first look at BFS.
