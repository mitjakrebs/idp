lemma finite_vertices:
  assumes "finite G"
  shows "finite (dVs G)"
  unfolding dVs_def
proof -
  have "{{v1, v2} |v1 v2. (v1, v2) \<in> G} = {(\<lambda>e. {fst e, snd e}) e |e. e \<in> G}" (is "?E = _")
    by simp
  also have "... = (\<lambda>e. {fst e, snd e}) ` G"
    by blast
  finally have "?E = (\<lambda>e. {fst e, snd e}) ` G"
    .
  moreover have "finite ..."
    using assms
    by simp
  ultimately have "finite ?E"
    by simp
  thus "finite (\<Union> ?E)"
